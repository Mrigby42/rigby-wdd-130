              Is this a good trip for kids?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              This is a great trip for all ages! Beacuase of the extensive amount of acitivies you can pick and choose how to spend your time here! There are activites for every age group. Also, the time of year you come also can affect how your trip is! If you have small children and want a quiet place with less people, you might consider coming at the beginning and end of season. This way you will have empty beaches and a calm environment.

            How expensive is it to rent a room?
            </dt>
            <dd>
              Rooms vary by price! If you want one of our newly refurbished rooms they will be a litle more expensive. Our prices vary from $120 a night to $200 a night. We also have special pacakages that can be purchased that can be set up on the table prior to your arrival.   <br>
              
            <dt>Where is there to eat?</dt>
            <dd>
              In the bottom level of the lodge there is a 5 star restaraunt! We recruit chefs from all over the country to meet our guests satisfaction! We also have a lakeside grill right on the beach! There you will find less expensive lunch items such as burgers, fries and icecream!
            </dd>
            <dt>What do I need to bring?</dt>
            <dd>
              This can vary depeding on the activities that you decide to do! If you want to spend the day at the lake we would suggest that you bring swimsuits, shorts, t-shirts etc. Water shoes can be nice if you are worried about stepping on sharp rocks or other objects in the water. Sunscreen is important to bring as well! Because of our unusual high elevation it is much easier to get burnt by the sun. If you are going horseback riding, you are required to wear close toed shoes as well as long pants. A hat is also recommended. When hiking the majestic peaks it is good to bring an insulated jacket. The tops of peaks are always pretty cold and windy! Hiking with hats, and good sturdy hiking boots are always recommended as well. 
            </dd>
            <dt>What is so great about the Sawtooths anyway?</dt>
            <dd>
        That is an excellent quesiton! In our opinion the Sawtooths put the Tetons to shame!! They cover an astonishing 678 square miles of central Idaho. They reach a maximum elevation of 10,751 feet at the summit of Thompson peak (which you can actually hike by the way!). In this mountain range you will find scenic views that you have only dreamed of. There are nearly 400 natural lakes spread across this area. Also, Sawtooth National Forest is in the center of it all. Here in the Sawtooths there is world class fishing, nature trails, hiking, mountain biking, backpacking, hotsprings and whitewater rafting. This is the one place that you can truly find everything you love.

            <dt>How far in advance should I book my trip?</dt>
            <dd>
              If you have specific dates you need, we recommend booking a year
              in advance. If you can be more flexible 6 months in advance is
              usually sufficient. We do get sold out every season, but there is also a waiting list that we can put you on as well! If you are not able to get a room there are amazing camping sites right on the lake close by! If you would like more information about this you can contact the Sawtooth Forest Service (208-449-9897).
